# Image Classification

Image classification is a form of supervised learning where a model is trained to identify 
and categorize objects within images. AutoTrain simplifies the process, enabling you to 
train a state-of-the-art image classification model by simply uploading labeled example 
images.


## Preparing your data

To ensure your image classification model trains effectively, follow these guidelines for preparing your data:


### Organizing Images


Prepare a zip file containing your categorized images. Each category should have its own 
subfolder named after the class it represents. For example, to differentiate between 
'cats' and 'dogs', your zip file structure should resemble the following:


```
cats_and_dogs.zip
├── cats
│   ├── cat.1.jpg
│   ├── cat.2.jpg
│   ├── cat.3.jpg
│   └── ...
└── dogs
    ├── dog.1.jpg
    ├── dog.2.jpg
    ├── dog.3.jpg
    └── ...
```

### Image Requirements

- Format: Ensure all images are in JPEG, JPG, or PNG format.

- Quantity: Include at least 5 images per class to provide the model with sufficient examples for learning.

- Exclusivity: The zip file should exclusively contain folders named after the classes, 
and these folders should only contain relevant images. No additional files or nested 
folders should be included.


** Additional Tips** 

- Uniformity: While not required, having images of similar sizes and resolutions can help improve model performance.

- Variability: Include a variety of images for each class to encompass the range of 
appearances and contexts the model might encounter in real-world scenarios.

Some points to keep in mind:

- The zip file should contain multiple folders (the classes), each folder should contain images of a single class.
- The name of the folder should be the name of the class.
- The images must be jpeg, jpg or png.
- There should be at least 5 images per class.
- There must not be any other files in the zip file.
- There must not be any other folders inside the zip folder.

When train.zip is decompressed, it creates two folders: cats and dogs. these are the two categories for classification. The images for both categories are in their respective folders. You can have as many categories as you want.

## Parameters

```
  --batch-size BATCH_SIZE
                        Training batch size to use
  --seed SEED           Random seed for reproducibility
  --epochs EPOCHS       Number of training epochs
  --gradient_accumulation GRADIENT_ACCUMULATION
                        Gradient accumulation steps
  --disable_gradient_checkpointing
                        Disable gradient checkpointing
  --lr LR               Learning rate
  --log {none,wandb,tensorboard}
                        Use experiment tracking
  --image-column IMAGE_COLUMN
                        Image column to use
  --target-column TARGET_COLUMN
                        Target column to use
  --warmup-ratio WARMUP_RATIO
                        Define the proportion of training to be dedicated to a linear warmup where learning rate gradually increases. This can help
                        in stabilizing the training process early on. Default ratio is 0.1.
  --optimizer OPTIMIZER
                        Choose the optimizer algorithm for training the model. Different optimizers can affect the training speed and model
                        performance. 'adamw_torch' is used by default.
  --scheduler SCHEDULER
                        Select the learning rate scheduler to adjust the learning rate based on the number of epochs. 'linear' decreases the
                        learning rate linearly from the initial lr set. Default is 'linear'. Try 'cosine' for a cosine annealing schedule.
  --weight-decay WEIGHT_DECAY
                        Set the weight decay rate to apply for regularization. Helps in preventing the model from overfitting by penalizing large
                        weights. Default is 0.0, meaning no weight decay is applied.
  --max-grad-norm MAX_GRAD_NORM
                        Specify the maximum norm of the gradients for gradient clipping. Gradient clipping is used to prevent the exploding gradient
                        problem in deep neural networks. Default is 1.0.
  --logging-steps LOGGING_STEPS
                        Determine how often to log training progress. Set this to the number of steps between each log output. -1 determines logging
                        steps automatically. Default is -1.
  --evaluation-strategy {steps,epoch,no}
                        Specify how often to evaluate the model performance. Options include 'no', 'steps', 'epoch'. 'epoch' evaluates at the end of
                        each training epoch by default.
  --save-total-limit SAVE_TOTAL_LIMIT
                        Limit the total number of model checkpoints to save. Helps manage disk space by retaining only the most recent checkpoints.
                        Default is to save only the latest one.
  --auto-find-batch-size
                        Enable automatic batch size determination based on your hardware capabilities. When set, it tries to find the largest batch
                        size that fits in memory.
  --mixed-precision {fp16,bf16,None}
                        Choose the precision mode for training to optimize performance and memory usage. Options are 'fp16', 'bf16', or None for
                        default precision. Default is None.

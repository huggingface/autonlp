# Image Scoring/Regression

Image scoring is a form of supervised learning where a model is trained to predict a 
score or value for an image. AutoTrain simplifies the process, enabling you to train a 
state-of-the-art image scoring model by simply uploading labeled example images.


## Preparing your data

To ensure your image scoring model trains effectively, follow these guidelines for preparing your data:


### Organizing Images


Prepare a zip file containing your images and metadata.jsonl.


```
Archive.zip
├── 0001.png
├── 0002.png
├── 0003.png
├── .
├── .
├── .
└── metadata.jsonl
```

Example for `metadata.jsonl`:

```
{"file_name": "0001.png", "target": 0.5}
{"file_name": "0002.png", "target": 0.7}
{"file_name": "0003.png", "target": 0.3}
```

Please note that metadata.jsonl should contain the `file_name` and the `target` value for each image.


### Image Requirements

- Format: Ensure all images are in JPEG, JPG, or PNG format.

- Quantity: Include at least 5 images to provide the model with sufficient examples for learning.

- Exclusivity: The zip file should exclusively contain images and metadata.jsonl.
No additional files or nested folders should be included.


Some points to keep in mind:

- The images must be jpeg, jpg or png.
- There should be at least 5 images per class.
- There must not be any other files in the zip file.
- There must not be any other folders inside the zip folder.

When train.zip is decompressed, it creates no folders: only images and metadata.jsonl.
